# BERT for Mental Health Monitoring

This repository contains a partial implementation of the code corresponding to the research paper titled "Harnessing the Power of Hugging Face Transformers for Predicting Mental Health Disorders in Social Networks".

## Paper Abstract
Early diagnosis of mental disorders and timely intervention can significantly improve treatment outcomes. This study investigates the application of social media data and pre-trained language models for predicting mental health disorder symptoms. We compare four different BERT models from Hugging Face with standard machine learning techniques commonly used in automatic depression diagnosis. Our results show that the proposed models outperform previous approaches, achieving an accuracy rate of up to 97%. Through our analysis, we uncover the potential of even small amounts of data, such as users' bio descriptions, in predicting mental disorders. Our findings demonstrate that social media data can serve as a valuable source for mental health screening, and pre-trained models can effectively automate this critical task.
